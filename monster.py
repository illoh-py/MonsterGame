#This class defines a generic monster
#It doesn't actually DO anything.
#It just gives you a template for how a monster works.

#We can make any number of monsters and have them fight
#they just all need to INHERIT from this one so that work the same way

#Since this class is not intended to be used
#none of the methods do anything
#This class is cannot be used by itself.
